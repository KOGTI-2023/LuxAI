# Continue Your Work

This application is designed to help you continue your work. The necessary data folders are missing and need to be created. These include:

- `data/`
- `docker-compose/`
- `models/`
- `static/`
- `templates/`

## Directory Structure

- `app.py`: The main application file. It uses data from the `data/` directory, machine learning models from the `models/` directory, static files from the `static/` directory, and HTML templates from the `templates/` directory. It may also reference the `docker-compose/` directory.

- `data/`: This directory will contain data files that are used by `app.py`.

- `docker-compose/`: This directory may contain additional docker-compose files that are used by `app.py`.

- `models/`: This directory will contain machine learning models that are used by `app.py`.

- `static/`: This directory will contain static files like CSS and JavaScript that are used by `app.py`.

- `templates/`: This directory will contain HTML templates that are used by `app.py`.

## Getting Started

To get started, create the missing directories and populate them with the necessary files. Then, run the `app.py` file.

## Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file references the `app.py` file and the directories `data/`, `docker-compose/`, `models/`, `static/`, and `templates/`. Make sure all these files and directories are in place before running the docker-compose command.

## Shared Dependencies

- Data schemas: Shared between `app.py`, `data/`, and `models/`.
- Exported variables: Shared between all files and directories.
- DOM element id names: Shared between `app.py`, `static/`, and `templates/`.
- Message names: Shared between all files and directories.
- Function names: Shared between `app.py`, `static/`, and `templates/`.

Please ensure these shared dependencies are consistent across all files and directories.
